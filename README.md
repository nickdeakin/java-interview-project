# java Interview Project #

## Introduction ##

There is a class with 3 methods, __InterviewImpl__
* __sortArray__

The intention of this method is to sort the input array into either ascending or descending order. 

* __filterArray__

The intention of this method is to filter the input array so only values between the min and max values are returned.

* __textTester__

This method returns a hardcoded value supplied by the Texty class

There is an accompanying test class, __InterviewTest__

There are a few test methods written, or partially written to test the methods in __InterviewImpl__

## Tasks ##

* Add the code to sortArray and filterArray method to correctly return what is expected
* Complete the test methods
* Ensure the tests are passing

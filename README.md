# java Interview Project #

## Introduction ##

Requires Java 11, maven and an IDE 

There is a class with 3 methods, __InterviewImpl__
* __sortArray__

The intention of this method is to sort the input array into either ascending or descending order. 

* __filterArray__

The intention of this method is to filter the input array so only values between the min and max values, including the min and max, are returned.

* __textTester__

This method returns a hardcoded value supplied by the Texty class

There is an accompanying test class, __InterviewTest__

There are a few test methods written, or partially written to test the methods in __InterviewImpl__

## Tasks ##

* Add the code to sortArray in ascending and descending order. Run the corresponding tests.
* Add the code to filterArray method to correctly return what is expected.
* Complete the test method to test the filterArray method.
* Mock the texty class.
* Ensure the tests are passing
